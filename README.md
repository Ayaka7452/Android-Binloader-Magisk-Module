# Android Binaries Loader
a Magisk module that provides a simplified command-line packager to load various binaries/scripts/executables into Android system

## What is this
This is a command-line utility for Android devices. It provides a packager(bpkg), which enables us to load various
useful utils with a simple package. With this, we are not needed to write a new Magisk module for a single script.

## Installation
Step 1 - Download the latest flashable zip from Release page of this repo;<br />
Step 2 - Put the zip into the sdcard, and flash it via Magisk app;<br />
Step 3 - Launch terminal emulator app, and type 'binloader', it will be initilized;<br />
Step 4 - Reboot and enjoy.<br />

## Usage
bpkg + [Options] + [Parameters]<br />
Options:<br />
>install [path] - install a new package"<br />
    remove [path] - remove a installed package"<br />
    ls - list all installed packages"<br />
    ver - show blcore version information"<br />
    help - show this help screen"<br />

## Make a Package
### Package Structure
â”€ util_1.0 [folder]<br />
----programs [folder] ---- custom_applet.sh<br />
----pkginfo [file]<br />
### pkginfo File Content
Total 4 tags of this metadata file, they are:<br />
pkgname=[YOUR_APPLET]<br />
version=[APPLET_VERSION]<br />
execpath=[custom_applet.sh]<br />
execname=[NAME_OF_EXEC]<br />
* execname is the spell of the command which you access this applet in terminal to.
### Try Packing a Script
For example we have script 'custom_applet.sh', following these simple steps:<br />
Step 1 - create a folder named 'programs';<br />
Step 2 - copy the 'custom_applet.sh' to 'programs' folder;<br />
Step 3 - write pkginfo file according to the format above;<br />
Step 4 - pack the folder and pkginfo with tar format;<br />
Step 5 - install the tar file using 'bpkg install [file_path]' command and reboot.<br />
After this, you can access your brand new applet via terminal.<br />
